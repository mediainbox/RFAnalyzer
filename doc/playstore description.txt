Turn your HackRF (+ USB OTG cable) into a real time frequency analyzer!

Use an OTG (on-the-go) USB cable to connect your HackRF to an Android phone/tablet and this app will show you the RF spectrum
(frequency magnitude and waterfall plot)!
You can browse through the frequency spectrum just by using scroll and zoom touch gestures. Additional features as of today are:
- select FFT size
- activate optional averaging and peak holding
- select color schema for the waterfall plot
- select drawing types for the FFT: line or bars
- read samples from a file (generated by Michael Ossmann's hackrf_transfer tool)

This app is in active development and I'm currently working on audio demodulation (AM, FM, ...) and support for the
RTL-SDR. These features will hopefully come soon. I also try to keep the app stable and as bug-free as possible. Bug
reports are always welcome and I promise to work hard to resolve every one of them! Note that there is a logging
feature in the settings which helps a lot with trouble shooting any errors.


WHAT YOU NEED:
In order to use this app you will need:
- A HackRF (this is obvious xD)
- An Android device that either supports USB OTG (please google if your device supports OTG!) or has an USB host port
- An USB OTG cable (costs about 3$) to connect the HackRF to your Android device (not needed if your device has a full
  size USB host port)


IMPORTANT:
The HackRF is powered by the Android phone/tablet. Some phones or tablets might not deliver enough power on their USB port
to power the HackRF. Also notice that doing the necessary digital signal processing is very CPU intensive and though I
did my best to optimize the algorithms the app still needs a 
decent device (I recommend 2 CPU cores or more) to run fluently. Please use the 2-hour refund period provided for every 
Google Play app to test functionality and refund the app if it does not work for your device!

If the app is working for you and your device is not in this list, please include your phone type in a short rating
and share the good news with other users ;)

Here is a list of devices that were reported NOT to work with this app (may be incomplete):

You might wonder why you have to pay for a free app: You don't have to! The APK package is also available in the
git repository and you can download and install it from there. But keep in mind: by buying the app you will get automatic
updates and you will support my work!
